      <h2>Welcome to Nick's Game Reviews!</h2>
      <p>
        Most Game review websites have reviews that you can't fully trust are
        from real players or not. That's why on this website I review games that
        I have played, so that fellow gamers can have a good insight on games as
        an actual player and might want to check them out.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          I also take suggestions of games to play at some point so I can review
          them!</strong

          <p>
            Minecraft is a game that defies conventional gaming norms and has
            carved out a unique niche in the world of interactive entertainment.
            While its graphics might not boast the latest visual advancements,
            it more than compensates with its unparalleled freedom and boundless

        <h3>Portal</h3>
        <div class="review-text">
          <p>
            Portal, a unique and mind-bending puzzle game, managed to tickle my
            funny bone and keep me engaged with its clever humor and intriguing
            storyline. While the gameplay itself is the star of the show, the
            infusion of witty jokes and an intriguing narrative adds an extra
            layer of enjoyment to this classic title...

        If you wish to play these games yourself you can get most of them from
        steam.

        If a game is not avaliable on steam you can find the game developers
        website by searching on google.
