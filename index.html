      <h2>Welcome to Nick's Game Reviews!</h2>
      <p>
        Most Game review websites have reviews that you can't fully trust are
        from real players or not. That's why on this website I review games that
        I have played, so that fellow gamers can have a good insight on games as
        an actual player and might want to check them out.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also take suggestions of games to play at some point so I can review
        them!

        <h3>Minecraft</h3>
        <p>
          Minecraft is a creative sandbox game which gives the player alot of
          freedom to play arround with. Since it is a Sandbox game Though the
          grafics might be simplistic and in some cases quite outdated. It is
          still a great game to play, and can be espacialy good with friends.
